    <h1>Explore WWU Project</h1>
    <p>Contributors: Tristan Hertzog and Jaxon Powell</p>
    <h3>About the Project:</h3>
    <p>
        The project was a Unity 3D exploration game that recreated Western Washington Universityâ€™s campus. 
        Every building and structure was custom modeled in Blender, with no imported assets used. 
        The project was developed by Tristan Hertzog and Jaxon Powell and served as their first experience with 3D 
        modeling and environment design. They used a minimal set of materials 
        and focused on accurately capturing the layout and atmosphere of the campus.
